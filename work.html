                        <p>Kinshift is the product of the work term that me and a team of other students from NSCC completed in the summer of 2016.  It was a labour of love.  I was part of the web development team that created the websites designed to promote our app.  If you would like to look into this more feel free to click the title to check it out!</p>

                        <p>Almighty Software was the company that me and the same group of NSCC students created.  We decided instead of getting hired by a company for our work term we would create our own work term.  It was very challenging but definitely worth the experience.  Feel free to check out the site.  It was created using a drupal installation.</p>

                        <p>3 in a row is a game that I created in my Javascript course while attending NSCC.  The goal of the game is to fill the board with red and green such that no colors have a string of 3 in a row but while also having an even number of both colors in each row and column. I'll plan on implementing the code to my website soon so you can play it for yourself!</p>
